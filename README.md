# Traxy — Activity & Habit Tracker

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-traxy.app-blue)](https://www.traxy.app)

Traxy is a lightweight, **social** habit-tracking app built with Python (Flask/FastAPI), Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Record daily activities on a calendar grid, share selected trackers with friends, and manage real-time friend requests—all without page reloads.

## 🏗️ Architecture

1. **Backend**  
   - Python 3.9+ with **Flask** (front-end proxy) and **FastAPI** (core API)  
   - SQLAlchemy ORM → PostgreSQL / Cloud SQL  
   - Notifications & friend-requests stored in a `notifications` table  
   - Google Pub/Sub + Server-Sent Events for real-time inbox updates  

2. **Frontend**  
   - **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling  
   - Vanilla JS + **SortableJS** for drag-and-drop UI  
   - Calendar rendering in `/static/js/calendar.js`  
   - Friend-overlay & delete-mode in `/static/js/friends.js`  

3. **Deployment**  
   - Containerized via Docker → Cloud Run (or VM + systemd)  
   - HTTPS everywhere (Let’s Encrypt)  
   - CI/CD pipelines for migrations & tests
